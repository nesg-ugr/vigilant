# VIGILANT

**Verification of Intent and Generation of Intelligent Logic for Automated actions against Network and systems security Threats**

VIGILANT is a research-driven, open framework to **analyze, diagnose, and respond to security incidents using Large Language Models (LLMs)**. It focuses on **natural-language interaction**, **encoding heterogeneous security data (logs, NIDS alerts, network traces/PCAP)**, **intent-to-configuration translation**, and **safe validation of proposed actions in simulation** before touching production.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key capabilities

- **Data ingestion & encoding** of heterogeneous security sources (logs, IDS alerts, network traces/PCAP) into LLM-interpretable tokens/text.  
- **Natural-language queries** to accelerate incident inspection/diagnosis.  
- **Intent-based actions**: translate analyst intentions (in plain English/Spanish) into concrete security configurations (e.g., firewall policies).  
- **Action verification**: automatically validate proposed configurations in a **simulated environment** (a ‚Äúdigital twin‚Äù subset) before optional deployment.  
- **Fine-tuning/RAG options** to specialize models for cybersecurity tasks and external tool enrichment (e.g., CTI, visualization).

1. **System inputs**: analyst prompts + security data (logs, alerts, PCAP).  
2. **Data encoding**: transform raw sources into representative tokens/text for the LLM (unimodal) and explore **multimodal** paths for raw formats when feasible.  
3. **Request adaptation**: decompose complex prompts into sub-queries and iterate.  
4. **Response aggregation**: synthesize sub-answers into a coherent diagnosis.  
5. **Intention ‚Üí configuration**: map analyst intentions to actionable configs (e.g., iptables rules).  
6. **Simulation & validation**: test configurations in a controlled environment before real deployment.  
7. **External tool integration**: CTI lookups, plots, dashboards, etc.

## ü§ù Contributing

We welcome issues, discussions, and PRs!

1. Open an issue describing your proposal/bug with minimal repro.  
2. Follow the style checks: `ruff`, `black`, and `mypy` where applicable.  
3. Add/extend tests for new functionality.  
4. Ensure no sensitive data is committed; use synthetic/redacted samples only.
